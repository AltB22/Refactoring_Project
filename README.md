# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Upgrades to Accessibility Standards, Addition of Semantic Elements, General Refactoring

- The Horiseon web app needed upgrades to improve accessability and search engine optimization.
- I refactored the code to add in semantic HTML elements, ensure logical structure including sequential heading elements, added alt attributes to the images, and added a title.
- This project aims to solve issues of accessability, and improves search engine optimization.
- I learned over the course of the project about html structure, elements, semantic elements, HTML's interaction with CSS code, the importance of inserting comments, and the importance of and how to's of creating a README.md file in Markdown.
